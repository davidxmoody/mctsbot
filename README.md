## MCTSBot

This is the source code for my 3rd year Cambridge University dissertation project. It is a **Texas Hold 'em poker-bot** which uses the **Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm**.

I also wrote a [blog post about the project](https://davidxmoody.com/2014/mcts-in-texas-hold-em-poker-a-retrospective/). It contains some screenshots/graphs and commentary on how it went.

To be perfectly honest, this project does *not* represent my best work. I just wanted to upload this to prove I'd done it and in case it might be useful to someone.

Unfortunately the project won't build in its current state. Sorry about that. There are several missing files that I no longer have a copy of. Also, the bot runs as a plugin to [Poker Academy Pro](http://www.poker-academy.com/poker-software/) which I no longer have access to. [opentestbed](https://code.google.com/p/opentestbed/) may also work (although I have never tried it).

The dissertation itself is probably the most important part. I recommend reading the *Preparation* section for what the project does and how it does it. The *Evaluation* section also contains some interesting results and graphs.
